# Deterioration in commodity TOT

## Assumptions

* Simulate a permanent 10% drop in the relative price of $Pq_t^\star$ to $Pw_t^\star$ 
* The drop occurs within one year, and is expected to be permanent from the beginning

## Expected outcomes

Short run
* Drop in govt revenues,
* First debt, then reductions in expenditures or? increases in taxes
* Drop in GDP/demand
* Nominal depreciation
* Increases in inflation

Long run
* Real depreciation


## Implementation

* Take the baseline model
* Create a new variant or copy of the model, using a suitable parameter to reduce the relative price of $Pq_t^\star$ to $Pw_t^\star$ in steady state
* Create a steady state databank for the baseline model
* Use this databank to simulate the new variant of the model
